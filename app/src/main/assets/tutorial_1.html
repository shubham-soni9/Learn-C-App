        <h5 class="subheading">What is C++ (programming language)?</h5>
        <p class="text-content">
            C is a general-purpose, procedural, imperative computer programming language developed
            in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Telephone Laboratories for use with the UNIX
            operating
            system.</p>
        <p class="text-content">It has since spread to many other operating systems, and is now one of the most
            widely used programming languages. C has also greatly influenced many other popular
            languages,especially C++, which was originally designed as an enhancement to C.</p>
        <p class="text-content"> It is the
            most commonly used programming language for writing system software,though it is also
            widely used for writing applications</p>

        <h2 class="subheading"><span>Advantages of C Language</span></h2>
        <p class="text-content" >
            <span>1. C language is a building block for many other currently known languages.&nbsp;</span><span>C language has variety of data types and powerful operators. Due to this, programs written in C language are efficient, fast and easy to understand.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="text-content"><span>2. C is highly portable language. This means that C programs written for one computer can easily run on another computer without any change or by doing a little change.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="text-content"><span>3. There are only 32 keywords in ANSI C and its strength lies in its built-in functions. Several standard functions are available which can be used for developing programs.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="text-content"><span>4. Another important advantage of C is its ability to extend itself. A C program is basically a collection of functions that are supported by the C library this makes us easier to add our own functions to C library. Due to the availability of large number of functions, the programming task becomes simple.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="text-content"><span>5. C language is a structured programming language. This makes user to think of a problem in terms of function modules or blocks. Collection of these modules makes a complete program. This modular structure makes program debugging, testing and maintenance easier.</span>
        </p>
        <h3 class="subheading"><span>Disadvantages of C Language</span></h3>
        <p class="text-content"><span>1.&nbsp;C does not have concept of OOPs, that’s why C++ is developed.</span></p>
        <p class="text-content"><span>2. There is no runtime checking in C language.</span></p>
        <p class="text-content">
            <span>3. There is no strict type checking. For example, we can pass an integer value.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="text-content"><span>4. for the floating data type.</span></p>
        <p class="text-content"><span>5. C doesn’t have the concept of namespace.</span></p>
        <p class="text-content"><span>6. C doesn’t have the concept of constructor or destructor.</span></p>
