                <p>
                    A namespace is a declarative region that provides a scope to the identifiers
                    (the names of types, functions, variables, etc) inside it. Namespaces are used
                    to organize code into logical groups and to prevent name collisions that can
                    occur especially when your code base includes multiple libraries. All
                    identifiers at namespace scope are visible to one another without qualification.
                    Identifiers outside the namespace can access the members by using the fully
                    qualified name for each identifier.
